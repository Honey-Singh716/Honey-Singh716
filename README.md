## 🎯 About Me

I am a student at **IIT Jodhpur** with a strong interest in **machine learning and data science**.  
I actively work on **Kaggle** and personal projects, focusing on turning real datasets into meaningful models and insights.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Building machine learning projects and Kaggle notebooks  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation  
- Participating in Kaggle competitions to improve practical ML skills

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Beginner to intermediate ML projects  
- Kaggle notebooks and learning-focused competitions  
- Data analysis and model experimentation with clear explanations

### 🤝 I’m looking for help with
- Improving model performance and validation strategies  
- Gaining deeper intuition behind evaluation metrics  
- Writing clean, reproducible ML code and notebooks

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Machine learning fundamentals and classical algorithms  
- Introductory deep learning concepts  
- Practical data science workflows using real-world datasets

### 💬 Ask me about
- Python for data science  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Basic ML models and Kaggle workflows  
- Learning ML through hands-on experimentation

### ⚡ Fun fact
I learn concepts best by building notebooks and experimenting with real data rather than memorizing theory.
